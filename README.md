We get it, Office 365 Groups are powerful, but time spent searching for the right groups and content can impact adoption
and productivity. That’s why we created AvePoint GroupHub–to simplify the Groups experience–ultimately making everyone’s
lives a little easier, and more productive.
So, what’s GroupHub? It’s the place users go to find the groups they need, and access them in just two clicks, so they can
get to work quickly. It’s also where we grant your admins with powerful Groups management tools, so they can effectively
oversee and bring order to Office 365 Groups.

*  Easily create, find, navigate, and access Office 365 Groups from a single interface
*  Enable Microsoft Teams when creating a new Group on the GroupHub interface
* Access any Office 365 Groups service and related Microsoft Teams with just two clicks
* Access GroupHub from any platform, on any device, anytime
* Users can label their groups with relevant tags to reflect purpose, importance, or function
* Through integration with Cloud Governance, admins can publish organizational tags to appropriate groups
* "Hubs" allow users to create collections of groups based on filters, tags, or manual selection for easy future access
* Leverage native Office 365 Groups provisioning or Cloud Governance’s Groups provisioning from directly within GroupHub
* Administrators can configure native Office 365 Groups management settings without the need for PowerShell
